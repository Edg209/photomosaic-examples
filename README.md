# Photomosaic-Examples

This repository contains several example photomosaics setups. It is expected to be used alongside [this repository](https://github.com/Edg209/photomosaic).

Each project will contain the following:

* `README.md` - A readme that briefly describes each photomosaic.
* `parameters.json` - A JSON file containing the parameters used in the photomosaic. It follows the format described [here](https://github.com/Edg209/photomosaic/blob/main/overview.md).
* `target_image.png` - A PNG file containing the target image of the photomosaic
* `candidate_images` - A directory containing the candidate images used in the photomosaic format, each in PNG format.
